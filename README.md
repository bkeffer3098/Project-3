Background

Throughout the course of our presentation, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of global life expectancy data gathered from the World Health Organization. Covering a span of data from 2000 to 2019, this data has been helpful in analyzing global life expectancy in a comprehensive, simple way. Our exploration encompassed several variables, ranging from 183 countries and three sex groups in 2019, providing an understanding of the life expectancy worldwide. 
	
Zooming in on the specifics, we delved into the dynamics of healthy life expectancy (HALE) at age 60. Visual aids, such as charts, maps, and graphs, were employed to illuminate global patterns and offer insights into life expectancy, with an inspiration taken from Blue Zones. Blue Zones are regions around the world where a higher-than-average number of people live longer and healthier lives. These areas have been studied by researchers and demographers to understand the factors that contribute to the longevity and well-being of the residents. The term "Blue Zones" was coined by Dan Buettner, a National Geographic Fellow, who identified and studied these regions. According to the National Institute of Health, “5 areas were dubbed Blue Zones, where people reach age 100 at 10 times greater rates than in the United States” (nih.gov). The longevity can be explained through 9 core characteristics called the Power 9. These include natural movement, living with a purpose in mind, having a sense of community, maintaining routines to reduce stress, eating primarily plant-based, not overeating, drinking wine moderately, putting family first, and finding the right friends. These have significant impacts on life expectancy. Our interest in Blue Zones led us to look at the life expectancies throughout the rest of the world.
	
Furthermore, a critical aspect of our analysis involved distinguishing between life expectancy and Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE). This differentiation adds a layer of depth to our understanding, emphasizing the importance of not just the quantity but the quality of years lived. As we navigate through key findings, implications, and limitations, we invite a thoughtful reflection on the broader implications of our insights, recognizing the potential impact on policy formulation and healthcare strategies on a global scale.

The Data & Our Analysis
	Our primary dataset, gathered from the World Health Organization (WHO) at https://www.who.int/, is the core of our analysis. It includes key variables such as country, sex, and year, offering a comprehensive view of global life expectancy patterns.
	For efficient data management, we utilized MongoDB as our storage solution. Its flexible structure facilitated easy organization and retrieval of information. Jupyter Notebook played a crucial role in merging datasets, seamlessly integrating our primary dataset 	with additional geospatial information.
	To enhance understanding, we employed a dynamic set of visualization tools such as Python, Pandas, JavaScript, Leaflet, and Plotly to enrich our analysis with interactive representation such as charts and maps. We were able to communicate the long dataset in a 	visually comprehensive manner.

Limitations & Future Study
It's important to note that certain planned features did not make it into our current analysis due to constraints. We initially aimed to implement granim.js for the incorporation of gradient color schemes and animations in webpage design. Regrettably, due to time limitations, this feature was deferred. Additionally, we would have added a visually enriching bar chart for cross-regional comparisons.  Although these features could have added depth to our analysis, they stand as potential routes.
